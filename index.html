    <h2>About Bree</h2>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Bree Jackson, and I am a Junior Full Stack Developer. After spending years crafting, painting, and woodworking on my own time, and seeing the tool that coding was, I decided to give building via code a try. Oh how rewarding it has been!! I have spent 3 months in intensive training at The Iron Yard, and have learned a lot- but I need to learn more! Though I am spending my time in Node.js right now, I look forward to the opportunity to learning Ruby, React, and whatever else comes my way in the future.</p>


    <p>When set with a task I work as hard as I can to find a solution. Unafraid to ask for help, I thrive in the ability to work in small teams where ideas can be bounced around and made real. As long as coffee is involved, I will always find the energy to keep on going.</p>

    <p>I look forward to meeting you! </p>
